### Answers
1) Would you use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “message” feature allows a user to write and send a message to another user.

ANS) No because the message feature was a dynamic input from a user and be sent to another user. Unit tests are not capable of doing complex tasks like that.

3) Would you use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “max message length” feature prevents the user from typing more than 80 characters.

ANS) Yes because you can test this by simply testing a message that is more than the max message length. This test is isolated to a single part of the function of the code see if that part of the code functions as assumed in isolation.
